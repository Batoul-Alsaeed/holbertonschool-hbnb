# 🏠 HBnB - Part 1: Technical Documentation

👋 Welcome! This is **Part 1** of the HBnB project — a simplified AirBnB-like system, developed as part of the **Holberton School - Tuwaik Academy** program.

The main focus of this part is designing a **three-layer architecture** using the **Facade Design Pattern**, with complete technical documentation to support future development.

---
## ✅ What’s Included

This repository includes the following:

- ✅ **High-Level Package Diagram** (Three-Layer Architecture)
- ✅ **Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer** (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- ✅ **Sequence Diagrams for API Calls** (Register, Create Place, Submit Review, etc.)
- ✅ **Compiled Documentation File** (`3-doc_compilation.md`)

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

We followed a **three-layer structure**:

- **Presentation Layer:** Handles user interaction (APIs, Services)
- **Business Logic Layer:** Core logic & models (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- **Persistence Layer:** Data storage and retrieval (DBStorage, FileStorage)

🔄 **Design Pattern Used:** *Facade* – for simplifying communication between layers.
