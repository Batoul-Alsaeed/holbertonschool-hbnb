## ðŸ§© High-Level Package Diagram â€“ HBnB Application

This diagram illustrates the **three-layer architecture** of the HBnB application and how these layers interact using the **Facade Pattern**.

```mermaid

    class PresentationLayer {
        <<Interface>>
        + UserAPI
        + PlaceAPI
        + ReviewAPI
    }

    class BusinessLogicLayer {
        + UserService
        + PlaceService
        + ReviewService
        + AmenityService
        + HBnBFacade
    }

    class PersistenceLayer {
        + UserRepository
        + PlaceRepository
        + ReviewRepository
        + AmenityRepository
    }

    PresentationLayer --> BusinessLogicLayer : via HBnBFacade
    BusinessLogicLayer --> PersistenceLayer : CRUD operations
```
ðŸ“¦ 1. Presentation Layer
Role: Interface between users and the system.

Components: UserAPI, PlaceAPI, ReviewAPI.

Responsibility: Handles client requests, authentication, and validation.

ðŸ§  2. Business Logic Layer
Role: Contains the main application logic.

Components: UserService, PlaceService, ReviewService, AmenityService, and HBnBFacade.

Responsibility: Processes data, applies business rules, and interfaces with persistence.

ðŸ’¾ 3. Persistence Layer
Role: Manages data storage and access.

Components: UserRepository, PlaceRepository, ReviewRepository, AmenityRepository.

Responsibility: Performs CRUD operations on the database.

ðŸ§± Facade Pattern
The HBnBFacade acts as a unified interface between the Presentation Layer and the Business Logic Layer. It simplifies interaction and decouples the components, promoting maintainability and scalability.
