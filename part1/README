# HBnB - Part 1

👋 Welcome! This is **Part 1** of the HBnB project.  
The main goal is to build a **three-layer architecture** using the **Facade Design Pattern** for clean separation of concerns and better scalability.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in the **early development stage**.  
More details and code will be added as we progress.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The project follows a classic **three-layer structure**:

- **Presentation Layer:** Handles user interaction (APIs, Services)
- **Business Logic Layer:** Core logic & models (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- **Persistence Layer:** Manages data storage and retrieval (DBStorage, FileStorage)

Design Pattern Used: **Facade** – to simplify and centralize communication between layers.
